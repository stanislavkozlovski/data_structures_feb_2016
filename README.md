# Lessons


1.[Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity](/Algorithms and Complexity/)
------
Overview of the course, introduction to the Big-O notation and why algorithm speed matters.

### Exercises
* Given slow and fast functions, compare their speed.

### Homework
* Given functions, figure out their Big-O complexity.


2.[Linear Data Structures – Lists](/Linear Data Structures - Lists/)
-----
Linked List, how a List(Vector) works and how it differs from a traditional array.

### Exercises
* Implement a [Double-Linked List](/Linear Data Structures - Lists/exercises/)

### Homework
* [Get the sum and average of a list of integers](/Linear Data Structures - Lists/homework/sum_and_average.py)

3.[Linear Data Structures – Stacks and Queues](/Linear Data Structures - Stacks and Queues/)
-----
Analysis of both data structures, their complexities and when to use which.
